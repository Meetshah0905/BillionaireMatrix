# Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Billionaire Matrix app to Netlify.

## Prerequisites

1. A Netlify account (sign up at https://netlify.com)
2. A Neon PostgreSQL database (or any PostgreSQL database)
3. Your database connection string

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Environment Variables

You'll need to set these environment variables in Netlify:

- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`)

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Deploy via Netlify CLI

1. Install Netlify CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Login to Netlify:
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. Initialize and deploy:
   ```bash
   netlify init
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

#### Option B: Deploy via Git (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket

2. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)

3. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"

4. Connect your Git repository

5. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist/public`
   - **Functions directory:** `netlify/functions`

6. Add environment variables:
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` with your PostgreSQL connection string

7. Click "Deploy site"

### 3. Post-Deployment

After deployment:

1. Your site will be available at `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

2. The app will work on both:
   - **Desktop browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - **Mobile browsers** (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, etc.)

3. Test the deployment:
   - Try adding a task
   - Test the theme toggle
   - Verify it works on mobile devices

## Mobile Optimization

The app is already optimized for mobile with:
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Touch-friendly buttons and inputs
- Mobile viewport meta tags
- Responsive typography and spacing

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check that `DATABASE_URL` is set in environment variables
- Review build logs in Netlify dashboard

### API Not Working

- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- Check Netlify Functions logs
- Ensure database is accessible from Netlify's servers

### Mobile Issues

- Clear browser cache
- Test in different mobile browsers
- Check responsive breakpoints in browser dev tools

## Support

For issues, check:
- Netlify Function logs in the dashboard
- Browser console for client-side errors
- Network tab for API request failures
