You are a senior web engineer + UX designer. Build a normal website (not a mobile app) that runs in all modern web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) and is responsive for both phone browsers and desktop.

Non-negotiable: this must look like a clean tool, not a flashy product

Do NOT use:

gradients, glows, glassmorphism, neon colors

giant rounded buttons, floating action buttons, card stacks

heavy animations, parallax, fancy effects

“credit card” UI

dark theme by default

Make it look like a calm, practical spreadsheet-like planner:

background: #fafafa or similar

text: near-black

thin borders, subtle separators

one accent color maximum (optional)

typography: system font stack

everything readable and clickable on mobile

Tech stack (website)

Build as a standard website using:

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript (deployed as a normal web site)

Styling: plain CSS Modules (no UI frameworks)

State: Zustand

Validation: Zod

Tests: Vitest + Testing Library

Persistence: localStorage (with versioning + migration)

No external APIs. No paid services. No API keys. No database required.

The Matrix model (exact logic)

Axes:

Energy: Gives vs Takes

Money: Makes vs Takes

Quadrants:

Gives Energy + Takes Money = PROTECT

Gives Energy + Makes Money = PRIORITIZE

Takes Energy + Takes Money = DELETE

Takes Energy + Makes Money = DELEGATE

Single-page layout (simple)

One page only: /

Top to bottom sections:

Header

Title: Billionaire Matrix

Subtitle: Classify tasks by energy and money

Task entry area (always visible)

Input: Task title (required)

Notes textarea: collapsed by default with “Add notes” toggle

Live suggestion panel (updates as user types)

Buttons: “Accept suggestion” and “Add task”

Manual overrides:

Energy: Gives / Takes toggle (radio buttons)

Money: Makes / Takes toggle (radio buttons)

These appear beside suggestion and override it

Matrix table (main UI)
Render a true table/grid (not cards):

2 columns (Takes Money, Makes Money)

2 rows (Gives Energy, Takes Energy)

Each cell shows:

Quadrant name as header

Plain list of tasks inside, as rows

Task row must show:

title

small text badges for Energy and Money

confidence % (if suggested/learned)

Edit button

Delete button

Utility bar (below matrix)

Search box (filters visible tasks)

Filters:

Quadrant filter (All / Protect / Prioritize / Delete / Delegate)

Energy filter (All / Gives / Takes)

Money filter (All / Makes / Takes)

Export JSON button (downloads file)

Import JSON button (file picker)

Reset learned rules button

Responsive behavior (phone + desktop)

On desktop:

Matrix displays as 2x2 grid side by side.

On phone:

Matrix becomes stacked:

Show row headers and columns in a readable vertical format

Example: show Protect, Prioritize, Delete, Delegate as collapsible sections or a stacked grid

Controls remain usable without horizontal scrolling.

Tap targets at least 44px tall.

Suggestion engine (offline heuristic, explainable)

Implement suggestClassification(text, customRules) as a pure function.

Requirements:

Works offline

Explainable output (Why)

Learns locally from user overrides

Input normalization

lowercase

remove punctuation

trim extra spaces

simple stemming: remove trailing “s”, “ing”, “ed” when reasonable

Base weighted keywords (must include these)

Money TAKES keywords (negative):
rent, bill, tax, subscription, fee, pay, purchase, buy, expense, insurance, debt, interest, groceries, fuel, repair, membership

Money MAKES keywords:
business, sales, sell, revenue, profit, client, invoice, freelance, marketing, close, lead, pitch, ship, launch, productize, pricing, raise prices

Energy GIVES keywords:
gym, workout, run, walk, sleep, meditate, family, friends, journaling, reading, sunlight, rest, plan, organize, meal prep

Energy TAKES keywords:
taxes, paperwork, admin, commute, meeting, conflict, argument, chores, cleaning, errands, waiting, complaint, support

Each keyword has a weight (1–5). Use weights to create a numeric score:

moneyScore: -5..+5

energyScore: -5..+5

Decision:

If moneyScore >= 0 => moneySide = makes else takes

If energyScore >= 0 => energySide = gives else takes

Confidence based on margin between competing scores; return 0–100

Phrase boosts (must implement these)

Hard-coded phrase patterns that override or strongly boost:

“file taxes” / “tax filing” => Takes Energy + Takes Money

“hire va” / “hire assistant” => Gives Energy + Takes Money

“launch mvp” => Takes Energy + Makes Money

“go to gym” / “gym” => Gives Energy + Takes Money

“business” => Gives Energy + Makes Money

Local learning by overrides

If user manually changes suggested sides and then adds the task:

Save a custom rule under normalized phrase:
customRules[phrase] = { energySide, moneySide, count }

Next time a matching phrase appears, suggestion should use this with high confidence.

Partial-match boost: if phrase contains a saved rule key or shares tokens, add weight.

Explainability panel

The suggestion panel must show:

Suggested quadrant

Confidence %

Matched keywords list

Numeric scores (moneyScore, energyScore)

If a learned rule was used, show “Learned from your past choice”

Data model (TypeScript)

Task:

id (uuid)

title

notes?

createdAt, updatedAt

energySide: "gives" | "takes"

moneySide: "makes" | "takes"

energyScore: number (-5..+5)

moneyScore: number (-5..+5)

source: "suggested" | "manual" | "learned"

suggestion: {
confidence: number;
matched: string[];
usedLearnedRule?: boolean;
moneyScoreRaw: number;
energyScoreRaw: number;
}

Editing tasks (must be clean)

Edit opens inline or in a small modal (plain styling):

change title/notes

override energy/money

saving updates quadrant placement

Storage rules

Persist:

tasks

customRules

schemaVersion

Implement a migration function:

if schemaVersion missing, treat as v1 and migrate safely

Accessibility & keyboard

Enter in title input adds task (if valid)

Tab order is logical

Buttons have accessible labels

Focus outlines visible

Deliverables

You must output a complete working repo with:

File tree

Every file fully included (no placeholders)

README with:

npm install

npm run dev

npm test

Tests:

Unit tests for suggestClassification with these exact expectations:

gym => gives + takes money

business => gives + makes money

tax filing => takes + takes money

hire VA => gives + takes money

launch MVP => takes + makes money

Unit test for quadrant mapping

UI test that types “gym”, clicks accept/add, and verifies it appears under PROTECT cell

Output format rules

When responding:

Start with the file tree

Then emit each file in its own fenced code block

At top of each file block include a comment with the relative path

The project must run immediately with npm install then npm run dev

Now generate the full codebase.
