Update the UI/UX. Keep the matrix/table approach, but redesign as a modern dark-theme productivity tool.

Hard rules

Must be dark theme by default.

No gradients, no glassmorphism, no neon glow, no heavy animation.

Use subtle borders, subtle shadows, and good spacing.

Everything must be readable with proper contrast (WCAG-ish).

Visual style goals

Think: Notion + Linear vibe (dark), clean and sharp.

Calm dark background

Clear hierarchy

Nice badges

“Empty” states that don’t look like placeholders

Quadrants feel like distinct panels without being loud

Design tokens (use CSS variables)

Implement a token system in globals.css (or CSS module) and use it everywhere:

:root {
  --bg: #0b0f14;
  --panel: #111827;
  --panel-2: #0f172a;
  --border: rgba(255,255,255,0.08);
  --border-2: rgba(255,255,255,0.12);

  --text: rgba(255,255,255,0.92);
  --muted: rgba(255,255,255,0.65);
  --faint: rgba(255,255,255,0.45);

  --accent: #7c3aed;         /* purple */
  --good: #22c55e;           /* green */
  --bad: #f97316;            /* orange */
  --danger: #ef4444;

  --radius: 14px;
  --radius-sm: 10px;
  --shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.35);
}

Layout improvements (make it feel designed)

Center the content with a max width (like 1100–1200px) and generous padding.

Increase spacing between quadrants (gap: 16px–20px).

Quadrant panels should have:

background --panel

a subtle border --border

slight shadow --shadow

rounded corners --radius

Quadrant header row:

sticky inside the panel (so title stays when list scrolls)

shows quadrant name + count on the right

small sublabel like “+Energy / -Money” under the quadrant name

Matrix styling (make axes look intentional)

Top axis labels (Takes Money / Makes Money) should be small caps, muted, letter spacing.

Left axis labels (Gives Energy / Takes Energy) should be vertical but tasteful:

on desktop: vertical label

on mobile: horizontal labels above each row (no rotated text)

Task rows (upgrade from boring list)

Each task should render as a compact row pill:

Background: slightly brighter than panel (--panel-2)

Border: --border

Padding: 10–12px

Title: medium weight

On hover (desktop): border becomes --border-2 and background slightly brighter

Right side actions: small icon buttons or text buttons “Edit / Delete” (no huge icons)

Badges:

Energy badge:

Gives = green tint, Takes = orange tint

Money badge:

Makes = green tint, Takes = orange tint
Badges should be tiny, uppercase, subtle, rounded.

Confidence:

Show as “Conf: 82%” in muted text, or a small thin bar.

If confidence < 55%, show “Low confidence” (muted warning).

Input area (make it clean and usable)

Top input section should be a single panel:

Two-column layout on desktop:

left: inputs

right: suggestion panel (“Suggested: PROTECT, Conf 78%, because: gym, workout, membership…”)

On mobile: stacks vertically.

Input styling:

Dark input backgrounds

clear focus state (outline using --accent)

Enter key adds task

A small “Override” area with radio toggles for Energy/Money

Buttons:

Primary button: solid accent background --accent

Secondary: neutral dark button with border

No floating buttons.

Empty states (make them not sad)

Instead of “No tasks”, use:

“Drop tasks here by adding above.”

show 2–3 example tasks in faint text inside empty quadrants (non-clickable hints).

Mobile responsiveness (important)

On phone:

Switch from 2x2 grid to stacked sections:

PROTECT, PRIORITIZE, DELETE, DELEGATE as four panels stacked.

Keep the axis meaning visible in each panel subtitle.

Keep counts visible.

Don’t force horizontal scrolling.

Deliverable change request

Refactor the current UI to match this design. Keep all existing logic.
Do not change the underlying quadrant logic or suggestion engine.

Also add a theme toggle (optional):

Dark default

Light theme available in Settings area or a small toggle at top right

Store theme preference in localStorage

Now update the code accordingly (CSS + layout + componen
