## How It Works

- All tasks and custom rules are stored in your browser's localStorage
- Data persists between sessions
- Each browser has its own separate data
- No server, no database, no API calls - just pure client-side JavaScript

## Browser Support

Works on all modern browsers:

## Data Storage

Your data is stored locally in your browser. To clear all data:

- Clear "Local Storage" for your site

## Notes

- Data is stored per browser/device

- Works completely offline after first load
